# Development and Research of Missile Guidance Calculation Using a Scanning Seeker Head
This project focuses on the development and research of missile guidance calculations utilizing a scanning seeker head. The system aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of missile targeting by employing advanced scanning techniques to track and guide the missile towards its target.

# Features
Advanced Scanning Technology: Utilizes a scanning seeker head to detect and track targets.
Accurate Missile Guidance: Implements precise guidance algorithms to improve missile targeting.
Real-Time Tracking: Continuously updates target coordinates for reliable guidance.
# Overview
The missile guidance system in this project is developed using advanced scanning technology. The scanning seeker head scans the environment, detects targets, and provides real-time updates on their coordinates. This information is then used to guide the missile accurately towards the target.
